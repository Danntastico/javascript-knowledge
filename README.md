# JAVASCRIPT ðŸ’›

## General Info

On this project, I'm going to write some examples of a huge list of JS core concepts like

- design patterns
- closures
- curious cases
- ...More

## Technologies

This project is created with:

- Javascript

## Design Patterns!

- [Creational Pattern](https://github.com/Danntastico/javascript-knowledge/tree/master/Design_patterns/creational-patterns)

This is the basis of a number of other DPs, the concept is very simple: **ways of creating objects**.

### Constructor Pattern

Ways to **implement** instances.

- Basics!

```javascript
function Avenger(name, power, team) {
  this.name = name;
  this.power = power;
  this.team = team;

  this.toString = () =>
    `${this.name} has the ability of ${this.power} and is part of team ${this.team}`;
}

var spiderMan = new Avenger('Spider man', 'spider sense', 'Iron Man');
```

- With Prototypes!

```javascript
function Book(name, author, year) {
  this.name = name;
  this.author = author;
  this.year = year;
}

Book.prototype.toString = function () {
  return `${this.name}, written by ${this.author} at ${this.year}`;
};

let nineteen84 = new Book('1984', 'Orwell', 1945);
```

### Singleton Pattern

In general, singleton is implemented by creating a class with a method that creates an instance if does not exist. If there's an instance already created, return its reference. **Singleton restricts instantiation** of classes.

In Javascript, singleton are **namespace providers**: Isolate implementation code from global ns, **provides** a single point of access for functions.
There's many ways to create a singleton in JS, a basic way could be as follows:

```javascript
let singleton = {
  //Simple object literal that groups their methods and properties.
  prop1: 'onion',
  prop2: 'tomatoes',
  cookFn: function () {
    console.log('Let`s cook');
  },
};
```
